# computer-vision-udacity
Udacity  is offering a good course in computer vision but the only thing that is making the pepole uncomfartable is instructor using matlab as tool.
Now a days python is improving a lot in field of computer vision. So my goal is to give a python approach helping you in understanding the udacity course with help of python
In this lessons you will use libraries numpy,scipy,matlplotlib,open cv.These lessons will also focus on convenlutional neural networks with help of tensorflow and pytourch.
